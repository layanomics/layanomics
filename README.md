## 🔬 Behind the Pipelines

During my BSc in Biotechnology & Biomolecular Chemistry, somewhere between pipetting samples and my first R script that made genes speak through statistics, I discovered my path in genomic data analysis.

I combined my background in biology with graduate-level studies in data science, focusing on statistics and machine learning. Now, I build pipelines and replicate published studies — from raw data to publication-ready figures.

## 💡My Niche in Bioinformatics  

- Bulk RNA-seq analysis (QC → DE → visualization)  
- Reproducing published transcriptomic studies  
- Statistical modeling of gene expression  
- Cloud-based bioinformatics workflows (GCP)  
- Reproducible, version-controlled scientific code  
- CRISPR-related differential expression analysis
