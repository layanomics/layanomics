## 👩‍🔬 Behind the Pipelines

During my BSc in Biotechnology & Biomolecular Chemistry, somewhere between pipetting samples and my first R script that made genes speak through statistics, I discovered my path in genomic data analysis.

I combined my background in biology with graduate-level studies in data science, focusing on statistics and machine learning. Now, I build pipelines and replicate published studies — from raw data to publication-ready figures.
